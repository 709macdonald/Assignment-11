I'm still hving some troubles formatting the second and third paragraph. Think I . might need some tips for that.
I tried setting u pa different API, I can not find a weather API that updates weather for St.John's NL Canda. This is somethign I figured would happen as no one (not even Canada) tends to recognize us as a habitable land. Trying to put in weather for Philledelphia (Cause it's always sunny there.) BUt at this point I can;t get it to return anything. I still have my weather widget API getting weather for Newfoundland but thats it. 
Any help would be appreciated!
